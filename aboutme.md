I am a final year student, pursuing Bachelor of Engineering (B.E)
focused in Industrial Engineering at the College of Engineering Guindy,
Anna University. I am an aspiring Data scientist, a front-end web
developer, a graphic designer and a blogger. \
 \
 I am a highly analytical student with a stark Mathematics background
and experience in Python, Machine learning and Statistics. I gained
practical experience with Data Science by proactively working with
real-life datasets in my five independent Machine Learning projects
preferentially using python and various sophisticated algorithms. I am
an active participant in Kaggle’s machine learning competitions and
HackerRank’s coding contests. I am a self-motivated student with proven
communication and outstanding leadership skills. \
 \
 I gained formal exposure to the foundational concepts — linear algebra,
probability and statistics through the courses in my curriculum. The
course ‘Python Programming’ aided me to become proficient in Python. In
the course ‘Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis’, I learned about
several machine learning algorithms. I have also enrolled in online
courses to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning offered by
University of Michigan, Stanford University and Deeplearning.ai. All
these courses broadened my skill set significantly and kindled my
interest to pursue analytics as a career. \
