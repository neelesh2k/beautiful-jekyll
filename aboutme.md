I am currently in the final year of Industrial Engineering at the College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University which is consistently ranked among the top 20 engineering colleges in the country. 
/

I worked as a Data Science Intern from March 2020 to August 2020 at GITAA Pvt. Ltd., an IITM incubated company, which was founded by experienced academicians from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. During my internship, I had the opportunity to work with Data Scientists and developed machine learning proofs of concept. I worked on developing data science case studies on Time Series Forecasting, and Hand Gesture Recognition. I also assisted in preparing the machine learning assignments, and quizzes for GITAA’s corporate training course.

I am a highly analytical student with a stark Mathematics background and experience in Python, Machine learning, and Statistics. I gained practical experience with Data Science by working with real-life datasets in my Machine Learning projects. I gained formal exposure to the foundational concepts — linear algebra, probability, and statistics through the courses in my curriculum. The course ‘Python Programming’ aided me to become proficient in Python. In the course ‘Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis’, I learned about several machine learning algorithms. I have also enrolled in online courses to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning offered by the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and Deeplearning.ai (http://Deeplearning.ai). All these courses broadened my skill set significantly and kindled my interest to pursue analytics as a career.

I am a self-motivated student with proven communication and outstanding leadership skills. During my tenure as the Joint Secretary of the department, I led a class of 50, managed the finance, marketing, and overall administration of the department’s events and symposium with 500+ participants. As the Deputy Director of Design, I mentored over 20 junior designers and designed the bi-monthly print issue with a viewership of 3000+. I am a part of almost every student-organized club or society in my college and organized various events throughout my college life.

I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work. I like to explore the relationship between numbers and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. I take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staff. Having scored more than 80% in all my semesters, I believe that I am consistent with my work.  Coming to my personal sphere, I am a blogger with 500k+ viewers in Quora. I have a passion for technology and keep myself updated with the latest trends in the world of technology. My hobbies include cooking, graphic designing, listening to TED Talks, and reading blogs on Medium.
