There has been an outrage on social media with hashtags like #BoycottChina, #BoycottChineseProducts as a result of the border standoff in Ladakh, and China being the cause for the spread of the virulent coronavirus. The numbers say that only 2% of China’s lucrative trade export is India bound. Therefore this movement will not beget as big as an impact on that country. The timing of such a move by Indians is also questionable. China has restarted its industrial operations and has been first off the mark in re-opening the economy after the COVID lockdown.

In the Indian smartphone market, four out of the five top-selling brands are from China. Companies like Xiaomi, OnePlus, Realme, Oppo, and Vivo understood the Indian mindset and offered feature-rich products at a low price. They have gradually built their base in the country over the past five years and are now reaping the benefits.
The dearth of competition from Indian manufacturers like Micromax, Lava, and Karbonn was also a crucial factor. Reliance Jio brought in the 4G revolution and these Indian brands could not satiate the demand for 4G-enabled devices. These Chinese counterparts came from a 4G-dominant market in China and duly capitalized.

India’s most smartphone sales come from the ₹5,000 to ₹15,000 price bracket and Samsung being a Korean brand is the only alternative here. Samsung had the scope to prove itself during this ‘Anti-Chinese’ period, but it surfaced with Galaxy M11 which had terrible specs for ₹11,000. The iPhones and Google Pixels are far beyond the budget of an average Indian. Hence, it is clear that there are very few alternatives in the current scenario.
The bottom line is that for an average Indian who is losing his job during this pandemic, he is left with no other option rather than buying a Chinese smartphone.
