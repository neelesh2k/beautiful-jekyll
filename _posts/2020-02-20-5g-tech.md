5G is here — Well, sort of. The 5th generation of wireless network technology has the potential to transform the internet with its dramatic speed and reduced latency. But in 2020, this technology is like the ‘Folding Phones’. They are not ready for commercial use, but we are seeing a glimpse of the future. A 5G connection could theoretically hit 10 gigabits per second — that is 100 times faster than the data networks we all use today. It would take just a little over 3.5 seconds to download a 2-hour movie!

It is estimated that even by 2025, this network will be behind 4G in terms of global mobile connections. The mainstream existence of 5G is encountering multiple hurdles. The 3G and 4G networks are relatively cheaper to set up as they are capable of rolling on existing radio frequencies. But to get gigabit speeds, carriers will have to use higher frequencies, known as millimeter-wave. This millimeter-wave demands a brand-new infrastructure as they drop off faster with distance. So cellular providers will have to use a large number of smaller, lower-power base stations rather than fewer, more powerful macrocells to offer the multi-gigabit speeds that millimeter-wave networks promise.

The future of this modern technology is indubitably promising. The subsequent generations of self-driving cars will interact with other cars to improve safety and manage traffic. While automobiles are exchanging small packets of information, they need to be instantly exchanged. Even half a second delay in response time could result in a catastrophe. That is where the 5G’s millisecond latency comes into play. 

But is 5G safe? There have been a plethora of conspiracy theories going around 5G. Some theories say that this radiation was the cause of COVID19. However, experts claimed that these waves fall under the non-ionizing portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Ionizing radiations have high energy content and prolonged exposure could cause cell damage in humans. Non-Ionizing radiations do not have enough energy content and heating is the only proven effect. 

None of these issues are actually new. The transition from 2G to 3G, or from 3G to LTE, saw similar problems and the tech industry was able to solve them. Smartphone manufacturers like Samsung, OnePlus, LG, and Apple has started to ship 5G phones or is expected to start shipping by the end of 2020. The mainstream usage of this technology might not happen overnight in India, but 5G is coming.
