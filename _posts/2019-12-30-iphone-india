India is a home for 1.32 billion people. By 2024, it will pass China and become the most populous country in the world. Despite being decades behind in basic infrastructure like schools and sanitation, India’s GDP is among the fastest in the world which means 1.3 billion potential customers. When companies like Google, Uber and Amazon struggled to enter and compete with the locals like Baidu and Alibaba in China, they have largely succeeded in India. Apple is only a tiny sliver in the Indian market.

Apple went from selling 1 million phones in 2007 to 11 million in 2008, all the way to a record breaking 231 million phones in 2015. But then, something has changed. In the last four years, the sales has been flat with no significant growth. Apple being a public company, it’s stock market is based on the expectation on growth. Today it may sell the same number of phones but more profit is made thanks to the pricing of the newer phones and by charging the existing users on Apple Music, iCloud, Apple watch, Airpods and Apple TV+.

Apple’s strategy of raising prices is backfiring in India. India’s per-capita income is $1,939 which is way less compared to China which has a per-capita income of $8,827. The iPhone 11 starts at $699 in the US but is sold at Rs. 64,900 (around $920) in India. With 75% of smartphones in India being sold at less than $250, for most people the iPhone is not a value for money product. Adding to that, the iPhone in India is not as good as the iPhone in other countries. It lacks Apple Pay, Apple Maps is limited and Siri is still having a tough time in understanding the Indian dialects.

In meantime, Chinese brands like OnePlus, Oppo and Vivo carefully target the Indian market buy selling low-cost, locally-manufactured devices with great specs. Ultimately the reason why Apple can’t compete is because it’s reluctant to adapt.
