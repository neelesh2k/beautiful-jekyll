Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It is broadly classified into three types.
* **Supervised Learning:**
    * It is the most common sub-branch of machine learning today. The algorithms are designed to learn by example. Models are trained on well-labeled data.
    * The objective of a supervised learning model is to predict the correct label for the unseen data. Each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector), and the desired output (supervisory signal).
    * During training, the algorithm searches for patterns that correlate with the desired output. After training, the algorithm takes in unseen inputs and classifies them.
    * The algorithm can be written as y = f(x)
        * x is the input.
        * y is the predicted output.
    * It is further classified into two sub-categories.
        * Classification
        * Regression
    * **Classification:**
        * It takes the input data and assigns it to a class/category. An example of a classification algorithm is to predict whether an email is spam or not spam.
        * The model fits features in the data that correlate to a class and creates a mapping function.
        * This mapping function will be used to classify the unseen data.
